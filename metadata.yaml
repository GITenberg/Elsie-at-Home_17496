description: Elsie's family continues to grow and flourish, embracing both new life
  as well as death. Evelyn's mother, Laura Leland, is very ill with consumption; brothers
  Arthur and Calhoun Conley both become fathers. Rosie Travilla and Will Croly tie
  the knot, as do long-time bachelor Dick Percival and Maud Dinsmore. In the midst
  of change, the family remains steadfastly thankful for all that God has gfiven them.
